# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

``--- question 1 fill here ---``

where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is auto
generated in the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image to
the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

```markdown
![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)
```

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

will generate an `.html` page of your report. After deadline for answering this template, we will autoscrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate an `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final handin.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

will check your answers in this template against the constrains listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, have you included an image when asked to.

For both functions to work it is important that you do not rename anything. The script have two dependencies that can
be installed with `pip install click markdown`.

## Overall project checklist

The checklist is *exhaustic* which means that it includes everything that you could possible do on the project in
relation the curricilum in this course. Therefore, we do not expect at all that you have checked of all boxes at the
end of the project.

>
> Answer: MLOps 77

Group 77

### Question 2

> **Enter the study number for each member in the group**
>
> Example:
>
> *sXXXXXX, sXXXXXX, sXXXXXX*
>
> Answer:

s233423, s237214, 232470, s232468, s232452

### Question 3

> **What framework did you choose to work with and did it help you complete the project?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the*
> *package to do ... and ... in our project*.
>
> Answer:

We used the Transformers package from the Huggingface group. To make our model we used ViTForImageClassification functionality from the transformers package. It created the model for fine-tuning from the already pre-trained model. For training, we used the Trainer and TrainingArguments functionality from the same package. As their name suggests the TrainingArguments was used to define training arguments like evaluation steps, number of training epochs, etc. The Trainer was used for training the model. Using this package helped us in getting introduced to them, but also took too much of our time. Having the pre-trained model was useful in not having to make our own, but figuring out how to fine-tune it, was as challenging.

## Coding environment

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment.

### Question 4

> **Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go**
> **through to get an exact copy of your environment.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a*
> *complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands*
>
> Answer:

We used conda and pip to manage our dependencies in our project. Conda was used to create virtual environments with specific Python versions and pip to install packages in that environment. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using pipreqs command. To get a complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands (having conda and pip already installed on the device):
conda create â€“name myenv
conda activate myenv
pip install -r requirements.txt
To make sure that the requirements.txt file was regularly updated, each one of us would run the pipreqs command before pushing the code to github.

### Question 5

> **We expect that you initialized your project using the 	. Explain the overall structure of your**
> **code. Did you fill out every folder or only a subset?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder*
> *because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our*
> *experiments.*
> Answer:

We initialized our project using a Cookiecutter template. From the Cookiecutter template, we populated the `src`, `data`, `tests`, `reports`, `dockerfiles`, and `models` folders. We omitted the `notebooks`, `references`, and `docs` folders as we did not utilize any Jupyter notebooks in our project. Additionally, we have no references to other projects nor specific documentation.

We added a `config` folder containing configuration files for running our model and experiments. Within the `src` folder, you will find files dedicated to data processing, model construction, training, and prediction. The `data` folder includes DVC data files. The `reports` folder comprises the report for this course. The `dockerfiles` folder is utilized to store files used for building Docker images. Finally, the `models` folder serves as the repository for our pretrained models.

### Question 6

> **Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? Additionally, explain with your own words why these**
> **concepts matters in larger projects.**
>
> Answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Answer:

In this project, we have decided to implement good coding practices using Ruff and by employing pre-commit. The rules we have chosen to implement mostly involve checking for unnecessary whitespaces and tabs. Additionally, we have implemented checks to determine whether the imports are used or not. In large projects, there are many programmers who write code in different styles. With tools like Ruff, we ensure that the code is readable and easy to maintain. Another important benefit is that formatting helps avoid unnecessary merge conflicts.

## Version control

> In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
> corporate and increase the quality of your code.

### Question 7

> **How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?**
>
> Answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our*
> *application but also ... .*
>
> Answer:

In total, we have implemented 12 tests. Primarily, we are testing data and the model, as these are the most critical parts of our project. Additionally, we are evaluating the training and predicting functionalities of the model. To be more precise, we have implemented tests for the following files: `model.py`, `train_model.py`, `predict_model.py`, and `make_dataset.py`.

### Question 8

> **What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If you code had an code coverage of 100% (or close**
> **to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
> *code and even if we were then...*
>
> Answer:

The total code coverage is TODO , which includes all our source code.. We are close to achieving 100% coverage, providing us assurance that if someone were to introduce breaking changes, we have a high chance of detecting them. While having 100% coverage would mean that every line of code is executed at least once during tests, it does not imply that our code is bug-free, as not every scenario has been thoroughly tested. This also doesn't guarantee the coverage of all code paths, edge cases, or potential issues. When writing tests for our project, we should not solely focus on code coverage but also consider the effectiveness of our tests. This involves assessing how well they can detect possible errors.

### Question 9

> **Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and**
> **pull request can help improve version control.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in*
> *addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...*
>
> Answer:

While working on our project, we utilized branches and pull requests. The repository comprised two main branches: `main` and `develop`. The `main` branch served as the branch for a working product, commonly referred to as production, while the `develop` branch was dedicated to ongoing development. Each group member would create a new branch from `develop` when working on a specific part of the project. After completing the work on the code, the group member would initiate a pull request to merge their changes into the `develop` branch. To ensure the quality of the written code, we implemented checks such as requiring at least one person to review it, and ensuring that the pipeline was successful.

### Question 10

> **Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version**
> **control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.**
>

>
> Example:
> *We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our*
> *pipeline*

### Question 15

> **Docker is an important tool for creating containerized applications. Explain how you used docker in your**
> **experiments? Include how you would run your docker images and include a link to one of your docker files.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *For our project we developed several images: one for training, inference and deployment. For example to run the*
> *training docker image: `docker run trainer:latest lr=1e-3 batch_size=64`. Link to docker file: `<weblink>`*
>
> Answer:

Docker was used to containerize two applications in relation to our model: the [trainer](https://github.com/nmarg/Project-MLOperations/blob/main/dockerfiles/train.dockerfile) and the [predict server](https://github.com/nmarg/Project-MLOperations/blob/main/dockerfiles/server.dockerfile). The trainer image runs model training on data stored in our cloud bucket, while the predict server is built with a model to be deployed. Neither of these images had arguments when running them, as they were built with a config file embedded inside. Even though this could be optimized for configurability, we decided to stay with the config file approach and instead focus on the pipeline around the images. Therefore, to run for example predict server, we'd call: `docker run -p 8080:8080 predict_server:latest`. We had experimented with setting the port with a `$PORT` variable for the server, but found no use for it as we would use a constant port in the cloud anyway.


### Question 16

> **When running into bugs while trying to run your experiments, how did you perform debugging? Additionally, did you**
> **try to profile your code or do you think it is already perfect?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *Debugging method was dependent on group member. Some just used ... and others used ... . We did a single profiling*
> *run of our main code at some point that showed ...*
>
> Answer:

The debugging method was dependent on the group member. Some used print statements throughout our code, while others employed the built-in Python debugger. In the event that a team member was unsuccessful in debugging, he/she would reach out to another team member for help. This approach allowed us to solve problems more quickly, practice good teamwork, and gain insight into other peopleâ€™s tasks. We decided against profiling, as most of the code that could run slowly was taken from the transformers package. This makes our optimization significantly harder and more time-consuming. Furthermore, we believe that the rest of the written code runs well, as we have implemented the code review practice, ensuring that it performs at its fastest potential.

## Working in the cloud

> In the following section we would like to know more about your experience when developing in the cloud.

### Question 17

> **List all the GCP services that you made use of in your project and shortly explain what each service does?**
>
> Answer length: 50-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the following two services: Engine and Bucket. Engine is used for... and Bucket is used for...*
>
> Answer:

We used the following services in Google Cloud Platform for our project:
 - Cloud Storage: Bucket for training data and saved models
 - Cloud Build: Triggering an automated CI/CD pipeline with Cloud Triggers that sets up an environment, builds our docker images, then deploys the predict server to Cloud Run, all set up in cloudbuild.yaml. 
 - Cloud Run: Serverless deployment of our predict model based on the latest image built by Cloud Build.
